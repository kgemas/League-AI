Advanced customization for unsupported servers
===========
In some game distributions, you may encounter a case where the file path does not have a default value like in the settings file ```appsettings.json``` or the bot can't install itself. The workaround is to point each file to its correct address (the full path of the file). There are 6 files that need to be configured manually as shown below.

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/kgemas/League-AI/raw/main/Assets/adventureConfig.PNG">
</p>

Until the publisher fixes the bug, this configuration will remain active. Because the software needs to use these profiles to get permission to read the API.

Updates and patches
===========
- For stable operation, update to the new version when possible, the latest versions usually include bug fixes and new features.
- Starting from the following updates, the ```UpdateBotAI.exe``` tool will be attached to the file ```LeagueAI.zip``` at [release](https://github.com/kgemas/League-AI/releases/latest). Run the file ```UpdateBotAI.exe``` and it will replace the old versions by itself.

Support telegram group.
===
[LeagueAI - Github Kgemas (Vietnam)](https://t.me/+HBclRDdmP4pjYjNl)

Behavior rules:
1. For newbie: read the answer using the search function on github + telegram group before asking a question.
2. With members: be polite and help newcomers when possible.

I created a telegram group to help fix bugs faster, simply because I'm more active here.

The software itself is experimental software for new technologies.

I'm the only developer so it would be great if people help each other and I just need to take care of new unexplored issues.
